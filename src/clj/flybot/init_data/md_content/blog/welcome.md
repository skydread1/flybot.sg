# Welcome to our new site

## About the Implementation

This Website is as for now a SPA written entirely in Clojure(Script).

We have the following stack:
- [figwheel-main](https://figwheel.org/) for live code reloading
- [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) for react components
- [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) for DOM representation
- [reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit) for routing
- Content written in markdown and converted to hiccup at compile time via Clojure macro.

## Github repo
