# Mobile App Features

The mobile app has less features than the web app.

Our objective with the mobile app was to allow employees to add/edit blog posts directly from their phone.

As for now, a user can:
- Login/Logout with google account
- Add/edit/delete blog posts
- Preview a post before submitting

The app design and feature are basic and not deployed on any phone store.

We tested on iOS locally with **Xcode Simulator**.

Following is a preview of what we can currently do on the mobile app taken from Xcode simulator:
